                    <p>  For much of IoT/IIoT, "the brain of the system is in the cloud." While the 'things' generate data and respond to directives, the actual processing and analysis of the data (the 'smart' stuff) takes place on a cloud server. Upon completion of the analysis, the results are either communicated to a person or sent as directives to one or more actuators, or both. <br>

Under the best of circumstances, this process takes time. In some instances, the amount of time is inconsequential. In others, anything other than a sub-second response is critical. For example, situations where responses are needed to handle impending machine breakdowns for safety reasons. <br>

In the case of machine learning and AI, the IoT/IIoT architecture is changing. In many instances, the cloud is now used to create (deep learning) models after which the models are deployed to the 'edge' (typically to a gateway of some sort). Think of autonomous driving where the models are built on the cloud but deployed to auto for real-time inferencing. Teuvonet takes it one step further. Teuvonet's FPGA or GPU-based SoCs not only enable real-time inference but also real-time learning from high-speed sensor data. This takes the cloud out of the loop completely, also enabling real-time updates to the models.

                    <p>When compared to other OT and IT systems, the proliferation of digitally inter-connected things at the edge ‘increases the overall attack surface for networks.’  One of the major concerns is that these things and the other edge devices to which they are connected provide a point of entry for various types of security and physical attacks. This is exacerbated by the fact that the cloud to which most IoT/IIoT systems are connected is also vulnerable to a myriad of attacks.<br>While edge computing does increase the attack surface, one way to enhance security is to move key elements of the cloud processing to the edge.  This is what the Teuvonet system does. Because of it’s disconnected nature, the vulnerabilities of the cloud are substantially reduced.  Additionally, since more data is processed on local devices, it reduces the amount of data that is at risk during transit to-and-from the cloud.</p>

                    <p>In highly regulated, high risk industries, there is a need and, in some cases a legislative requirement (e.g. the GDPR in Europe), to explain the decisions made by AI/ML systems. Afterall, “We wouldn’t find it acceptable for humans to be making decisions without any oversight, so there’s no reason why we should accept it when machines make decisions.” (Harvard Review 2019).
            <br>
                        For the most part, machine learning training and modeling exist in a blackbox with little explanation of how or why particular results were produced.  The expectation is that organizations will, over time, be required to deploy AI tools that are explainable, transparent, and provable. While Teuvonet’s system rests on neural network technology, in the end it creates models that can be understood by humans. It does this by producing human understandable, IF-THEN type rules that delineate the key features or factors underlying each decision point. The result is an explainable model (XAI) that can be reviewed and audited, improving transparency and trust.</p>

                    <p>Traditional machine learning focuses on ‘generic’ models tuned to an average target population. These models are trained and tested with large, relatively static batch datasets of inputs and outputs. However, the world of IoT/IIoT is anything but static or complete, and the generic ‘one-size fits all’ approach doesn’t necessarily apply across all applications. This world rests primarily on dynamic, real-time, streaming data that not only requires building a ‘living’ model, but also one that can be optimized and ‘personalized’ for a specific case (e.g. a single individual,  machine, vehicle, etc.). <br>

While the Teuvonet system can handle the ‘generic’ case, as well as the batch data on which they are typically built, it’s designed to handle real-time streams and, when needed, personalized models that support incremental learning. These models require less data and can account for the idiosyncrasies of a system. Teuvonet can learn from the current data of the system, monitor deviations from that state, and adjust accordingly.</p>

                    <p>Regardless of the formal processes that are employed, machine learning involves a series of interrelated steps running from problem definition to system and model deployment. A number of these steps require ML expertise along with domain expertise including: data preparation, feature engineering, model selection (both across and within types), model setup and hyperparameter tuning, model training and testing, model validation and evaluation, model scaling, and system deployment and maintenance. <br> While it's impossible to eliminate the need for ML expertise entirely, it is possible to automate a number of these steps (AutoML), reducing the need for this expertise. Once the problem has been defined and the general class of model has been determined (e.g. regression vs. classification), the Teuvonet system automatically examines hundreds of models and features in parallel, finding the smallest feature set that best predicts the phenomenon of interest without requiring the input or assistance of an ML expert.</p>

The process consists of transferring and storing IoT sensor data on the cloud and then applying machine learning techniques on the data to build models. The models are then transferred to and used at the edge devices (e.g. a gateway, a car, a phone). This process is used by almost all IoT cloud platforms. Teuvonet’s technology can change this expensive process by learning (building models) locally, near the source of the data, without having to transfer/upload data to the cloud. Teuvonet employs patent-pending capabilities running on GPU or FPGA Systems on a Chip (SoCs) in order to train, test, and execute machine learning models, based on real-time data generated by sensors or other devices, at the IoT/IIoT Edge.</p>
                        <p>Need for real-time learning from high-speed streaming data

1RedDrop, 2019 - Real-Time Machine Learning (RTML): DARPA Throws Down the Gauntlet

“This year, the DARPA Grand Challenge brings machine learning to the forefront, but on a real-time basis. The Real-time Machine Learning program, which puts DARPA and the National Science Foundation in partnership, is about “the creation of a processor that can proactively interpret and learn from data in real-time, solve unfamiliar problems using what it has learned, and operate with the energy efficiency of the human brain.” Funding is set at $10 million for the winner……The challenge is split into two 18-month phases. Phase I hopes to eliminate the often prohibitive costs of application-specific ICs by creating hardware compilers that will allow ML-specific chips to be automatically created from high-level source code, while Phase II calls for two demo applications to be supported by the hardware optimization developed in Phase I.”

 

Note: Teuvonet has built the hardware compilers that DARPA and NSF wants.</p>

        <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>
